I built FiniteViz, a Web-Based Finite Element 3D Mesh Generator/Viewer, for my Msc Advanced Computer Science dissertation. FiniteViz is a microservices-based web application that efficiently sends and receives mesh data to and from C++ computation environment through a flask REST API and visualises such data on the client using Three.js.

FiniteViz is able to:
• Generate multiple Finite Element meshes scalably and
effectively,
• Accurately visualise 3D mesh results received from the server.
• Horizontally scale based on user load and requirements

FiniteViz was ultimately built to provide an example of a cost-effective
and efficient finite element mesh generation tool which could enable students and
smaller engineering teams to run their computations without having to purchase
proprietary software licenses.
